Look for common flag formats, such as 'CTF{...}', in the source code, hidden directories, or responses from the application. Use tools like Burp Suite for web challenges to intercept and modify requests, and examine responses for clues. For binary challenges, employ reverse engineering tools like Ghidra or Radare2 to analyze the executable code for potential flag outputs. Additionally, leverage techniques like directory brute-forcing with tools like Dirb or Gobuster to uncover hidden paths.

Identify vulnerable parameters: Use 'sqlmap -u <url> --dbs' to find SQL injection points. 3. Extract data: Use 'sqlmap -u <url> --dump' to extract data from the database. 4. Analyze the data: Review the extracted information for sensitive data, such as login credentials or flags. 5. Capture the flag: Use the data to access restricted areas where flags or sensitive information are stored."
